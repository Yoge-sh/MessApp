# Mess App

A mobile application for the Institute's Hostel Mess, currently sought to be implemented @ IIIT Dharwad ( https://www.iiitdwd.ac.in/ )
This application automates and digitalizes various activities like:
- Log Keeping
- Meal Ordering
- Complaint Registering
- Complaint Analysis
- Personal Expenditure Tracking
  

# Structure of the Project
1. Login with Institute Mail ID 🏫
2. Each user is provided with a role of either a Faculty/Student 👨‍🏫 or a Mess-Manager 👩‍🍳 or Admin
3. User Lands on the Home Page once authentication is Succesful ✨
4. Home Page allows user to track their recent transactions/orders and the their total expenses in the past month
5. Menu Section allows Faculty to see any changes in the menu for entered Day and Meal, Mess-Managers can instead update the menu if there are any changes in the same 🍲
6. Faculty can file Complaints in Complaint Section from NavBar , For Mess-Manager a list of filled complaints is shown instead
7. User settings showcase the details of the user as registered with the institute and thus cannot be changed✅
